### Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/subratamal/generic-repo.git
   cd generic-repo
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Development Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -e .[dev]
   ```

4. **Set up Pre-commit Hooks (Optional but Recommended)**
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```

## üß™ Running Tests

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=generic_repo --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_generic_repo.py

# Run tests matching a pattern
pytest -k "test_save"
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Run integration tests (requires AWS credentials)
pytest -m integration

# Skip slow tests
pytest -m "not slow"
```

### Test Coverage
We aim for at least 80% test coverage. Check coverage with:
```bash
pytest --cov=generic_repo --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html  # View coverage report
```

## üé® Code Style

This project follows strict code quality standards:

### Formatting and Linting
```bash
# Format code with Ruff
ruff format .

# Check for linting issues
ruff check .

# Fix auto-fixable issues
ruff check --fix .
```

### Type Checking
```bash
# Run type checking (when mypy is added)
mypy generic_repo/
```

### Security Checks
```bash
# Run security linting
bandit -r generic_repo/
```

## üìù Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make Changes
- Write your code following the existing patterns
- Add comprehensive docstrings
- Include type hints
- Write tests for new functionality
- Update documentation if needed

### 3. Test Your Changes
```bash

pytest

# Check code quality
ruff check .
ruff format --check .
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
```

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
